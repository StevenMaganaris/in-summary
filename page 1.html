 <p style="text-align:center;">Coming into my VAPA class web design, I really had no clue how to code. I had some previous knowledge, but that was all that cheesy stuff that you do in 5th grade. To me, codeing was something that I wanted to learn how to do for a while so when I saw the class I knew that I wanted to try it but I also knew that it was going to be hard and not easy.</p>
