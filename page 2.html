 <h1 style="text-align:center;">What I have learned</h1>
 <p style="text-align:center;">I have learned loads from this class. One thing that I have learned how to do is code. My knowlage is very basic, but I do know more then I did before. I also leanrned how to do job and salary searches. This is very important becasue when looking for a job, you need to look for the one that suits your strenths and weaknesses and what you like. The last thing that I have learned how to do is collaberate with another teamtes and peers. For example, when in the classroom I really felt like it was a loose environemnt and we were free to do what we wanted to as long as we completed our work.</p>
